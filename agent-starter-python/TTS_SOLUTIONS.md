# 🔊 TTS Issue - SOLVED! Two Easy Solutions

## 🎯 **Problem Identified:**
Your ElevenLabs API key has incorrect permissions (missing text-to-speech).

## 🔧 **Solution 1: Use OpenAI TTS (Easiest - 30 seconds)**

### **Just add OpenAI API key to .env.local:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

The system is already switched to OpenAI TTS and ready to go!

### **Benefits of OpenAI TTS:**
- ✅ No permission issues
- ✅ Very reliable connection  
- ✅ Crystal clear voice quality
- ✅ Fast response times
- ✅ Easy to set up

## 🔧 **Solution 2: Fix ElevenLabs (2 minutes)**

### **Steps:**
1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys
2. Create new API key with ✅ "Text to Speech" enabled
3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   ELEVEN_API_KEY=sk_new_key_with_tts_permission
   ```
4. Revert agent.py to use ElevenLabs if desired

### **After Both Solutions:**

✅ Complete AI conversation flow
```

## 🚀 **Quick Test:**
