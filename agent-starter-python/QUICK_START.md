# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Glow Beauty Salon AI System

## ✅ System Status: **READY FOR TESTING**

All core components are working perfectly! The only remaining step is adding your real API keys.

---

## 🔑 **Set Up API Keys (5 Minutes)**

### 1. LiveKit Cloud (Voice Platform)
- Go to [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/)
- Create a free account and new application
- Copy your credentials to `.env.local`

### 2. Groq AI (Fast Language Model)
- Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
- Sign up and create an API key
- Add to `.env.local`

### 3. ElevenLabs (High-Quality Voice)
- Go to [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/)
- Sign up and get an API key
- Add to `.env.local`

**All three have generous free tiers for testing!**

## 🎯 **Start the System**

Once API keys are set up:

```bash
# Start the complete system
uv run python src/main.py
```

You'll see:
```
🌟 GLOW BEAUTY SALON - AI RECEPTIONIST SYSTEM
============================================================
📊 Supervisor Dashboard: http://localhost:8000
🤖 AI Agent: Ready to receive calls via LiveKit
📱 Customer follow-up: Enabled
⏰ Timeout monitoring: Enabled (24 hours)
```

---

## 🎮 **Testing Options**

### Option 1: Console Test (Fastest)
```bash
uv run python src/agent.py console
```
Test the AI conversation directly in your terminal.

### Option 2: Dashboard Only
```bash
uv run python src/web_server.py
```
Open http://localhost:8000 to see the supervisor interface.

### Option 3: Full System
```bash
uv run python src/main.py
```
Launch everything: agent, dashboard, and monitoring.

## 🌐 **Access Points**

- **Supervisor Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000
- **Agent Console**: Run `uv run python src/agent.py console`
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

---

## 🎭 **Test Workflow**

1. **Open Dashboard**: Go to http://localhost:8000
2. **Test Agent**: Use console to ask questions:
   - "What are your hours?" (AI answers directly)
   - "Do you offer scalp micropigmentation?" (AI escalates)
3. **Check Dashboard**: See pending help requests
4. **Respond as Supervisor**: Type responses in dashboard
5. **Watch Follow-up**: Console shows customer notifications

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Agent Won't Start
```bash
# Check API keys
uv run python verify_setup.py

# Re-download models  
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

### Web Server Issues
```bash
# Check dependencies
uv sync

# Test database
uv run python -c "from src.database import Database; Database()"
```

### Common Errors
- **"Invalid API key"**: Check .env.local formatting
- **"No job context"**: Use console mode for testing
- **"Port 8000 in use"**: Stop other web services
